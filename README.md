# Sorting-Algorithm-Benchmarking-and-Analysis
This project benchmarks and compares the performance of Selection Sort and Merge Sort using empirical analysis. Each algorithm is evaluated based on critical operation counts and execution time across multiple input sizes and repeated trials. The results are written to output files and later analyzed and displayed in a graphical table.
